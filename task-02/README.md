# Terminal Chaos

## Part 1
Used the basic commands `ls` , `cd` to navigate the repository. With the help `tree` command, I found out the *parchment.py* easily , hence the initial code. All the codes can be found in the Handbook directory. 

## Part 2
`git checkout` was used to change the branch to *The Light Realm*. Upon entering the light realm, found alot of vegetation. So, again with the help of `tree` and `find`, found the names of the herbs. Moonbloom and Mistveil. The holy spell became *LnnmknnlLhrsdhk* . Navigated to the KharnokTheBloodForged.py in Citadel, used `python3` command to run it in terminal. Parried and i unlocked the Dark Book. 

## Part3
Switched branch using the `git checkout`.Again used the `tree` command and `cd` command to navigate to the Celestial Veil Amulet to open the chest. Unlocked the chest and obtained the Dark Book I and II. The codes are in the handbook.

## Part 4
Found the sh file that decodes base64.  
Encoded base64: aHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL2FtYW5zeGNhbGlidXIvVGVybWluYWwtQ2hhb3MtR29kU3VpdGU=  
Decoded string: https://github.com/amansxcalibur/Terminal-Chaos-GodSuite  

Cloned the repository to my device.

Used `git log`, `git commit`, and `git show` to find the secret code. Found yet another base64 sting and decoded it and it directed to yet another github repository.  
base64: aHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL2FuZ3JlemljaGF0dGVyYm94L1RvLXRoZS1zdGFycy1hbmQtcmVhbG1zLXVuc2Vlbg==  
Decoded: https://github.com/angrezichatterbox/To-the-stars-and-realms-unseen

Cloned the new repository and navigated to the victory.py and run it using `python3 victory.py --run` and I got the victory message.  

Learned about a few new commands such as `git branch -r`, `grep` ,`sh`etc.  


This was a fun task as it required me to put on my detective glasses. Initially, I encountered some confusion while searching for the "holy spell," mistakenly thinking that any herb containing "good" or "hope" would be part of the spell. Eventually, I figured it out. When I first uncovered the base64 encrypted code in GodSuite, the decoded link led to a dead end, so I set it aside for a while. A few weeks later, I revisited it, found the repository, and realized that the repository for the stars and unseen realms had only been created later.
