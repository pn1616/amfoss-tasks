## Introspection

### Introduction
I'm Pavithra Nair from S3 CSE-B. 

### Why should we choose you?
### How do you intend to contribute back to the club?
If I am accepted into the club, I am fully committed to actively participating in all its activities and contributing to its growth and success. I will devote my best efforts to helping the club reach new milestones. With a mindset that values openness and curiosity, I embrace both academic and technical opportunities for personal development. I am eager to volunteer at every club event and, in the future, aim to mentor and support my juniors as much as possible. I consistently stay updated on the latest trends in technology, and I believe that FOSS is a fantastic avenue to deepen my understanding in areas of interest while also enhancing my skills as an individual.
### What are your fields of interest, and how do you plan on working on them?
