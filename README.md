# amFOSS Praveshan'24
## Introspection

### *Introduction*
Hi! I’m Pavithra Nair, currently in S3 CSE-B. Last year, I was completely new to programming, but the Praveshan'23 tasks really helped kickstart my journey into coding. Even though I didn’t get past the interview process, the whole experience was incredibly valuable, and I learned a great deal in those early days as a programmer. I'm a hard worker and genuinely passionate about programming. I love solving problems and am always excited to learn new things. My enthusiasm for coding has only grown since then, and I’m constantly pushing myself to improve and explore new technologies.

### *Why should we choose you?*
I believe I am very much motivated and enthusiastic about programming as well as contributing to open-source. My introduction to programming started through initiatives like CS50 and amFOSS Praveshan'23 taught me a lot. I assure active participation, volunteering, and contribution to every event and project the club undertakes. In addition to my technical curiosity, the desire to learn and grow for myself and for others in the club drives me. It motivates me to foster collaboration and share knowledge.

### *How do you intend to contribute back to the club?*
If I am accepted into the club, I am fully committed to actively participating in all its activities and contributing to its growth and success. I will devote my best efforts to helping the club reach new milestones. With a mindset that values openness and curiosity, I embrace both academic and technical opportunities for personal development. I am eager to volunteer at every club event and, in the future, aim to mentor and support my juniors as much as possible. I consistently stay updated on the latest trends in technology, and I believe that FOSS is a fantastic avenue to deepen my understanding in areas of interest while also enhancing my skills as an individual.
### *What are your fields of interest, and how do you plan on working on them?*
Main interest is in web and application development; the area has attracted me because it allows the creation of useful and easy-to-use solutions that may be helpful for a significant number of users. I want to learn more from real projects, helping open-source communities, and keeping myself up to date on the newest technologies and trends.

In terms of web development, I see myself building responsive and scalable, visually appealing websites-giving equal emphasis to front-end as well as to back-end development. In the case of apps, I am interested in developing cross-platform applications and then development of class apps that work well on both Android and iOS.

I will complete the coding challenges, team projects, and learn from other developers who can guide me on acquiring more skills. In general, the idea is to improve the skills and make the tech community better.
